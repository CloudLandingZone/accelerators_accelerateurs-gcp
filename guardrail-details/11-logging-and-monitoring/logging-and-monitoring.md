## Logging and Monitoring

### Enable logging for the cloud environment and for cloud-based workloads.

In order to comply with this guardrail we will validate that a log sink asset and storage bucket is created for capturing platform logs.

This is performed in the `log_sinks.tf` file located [here](../deployment-templates/Terraform/guardrails/log_sinks.tf).
